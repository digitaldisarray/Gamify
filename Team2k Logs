(bad) ideas:
1: Homework into an rpg
- Gets assignments from school loop
- Click done on the assignment to get xp or whatever
- People have profiles on them

2. Our version of quizlet

3. Tetris clone
- multiplayer
- crazy colors
- different game modes
- hackable
- open source
- can edit look and feel of game through config file

4. Custom client for school loop with chat rooms for each class
- login page (enter name, student id, teachers, classes, grades)
- optional to get grades and info from school loop account
- each classroom has a chat room
- general/global chat rooms
- info pages for each class show things like average grades for different assignments
Things to do if we have time:
- Our own version of quizlet giving poitns to your account5

5. Custom spanish learning tool
- Live translator
- Integrated web browser with spanish dict
- Put computer on "lockdown" for specific ammount of time so students can't play games, talk to friends, watch youtube. Block specific domains. Customizable lockdown



Final: quizlet games ex tetris in order to rotate blocks you have to answer questions
snake eats translated word in time.

classes: term, studyset, account, main, game, dashboard,tetris, TetrisGamePiece, snake

Main:
main() {
    instanciate the user interface
}

Game super class:
game() {
    start() {
        Create a new jframe for the game to run in
    }
    
    exit() {
        go back to the main menu jframe thing
    }
}

Example terms.txt:
word:translatedWord\n
word:translatedWord\n
term:termDefinition\n
term:termDefinition


Kevin - Interface.jar
- Show a list of available games
- Let the user choose a txt file of terms to study
- Run the games passing the text file to them
- IF WE HAVE TIME Provide an editor for the tems.txt 

Brian - Tetris.jar
- String[] args will take a file name
- Generate the game based on the passed text file

Ayush - Snake.jar
- String[] args will take a file name
- Generate the game based on the passed text file

Eylam - Study Set.java
☺☻♥♦♣♠•◘○


How the dashboard works:
Kevin -> Interface.jar
\/ runs jar and passes a file name *string* in String[] args
Tetris.jar or Snake.jar

\/ sends file name to Eylams method/function // Instantiate new StudySet from textFile and that will contain the HashMap shit

\/ returns a HashMap of term and definition

Tetris.jar uses the hash map in the game

Things to do when we have time:
Game settings:
Definition to term vs Term to definition - Bryan Needs to Ayush needs to (might be in args from the Launcher instead of in game) args[1]
MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE - Bryan Done Ayush needs to
MAKE SURE IT TELLS THEM WHAT THE CORRECT TERM IS - Bryan Done Ayush needs to

Dashboard:
Fancy material icons
Seperate directories for games and study sets

Put this right after main(String[] args):
StudySet studySet = new StudySet(args[0]);

Key Points For Presentation:
-Fun
-Open Source/Customizable
-Students can make their own games, easy as drag and drop
-Edit lists within the Dashboard
